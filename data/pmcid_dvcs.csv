"730","TEAK, freely available at code.google.com/p/teak for Windows and MAC, is an innovative approach to detect activated subpathways. First, TEAK uses an in-house graph traversal algorithm to extract all root to leaf linear subpathways of a given pathway. Its major contributions include fully accounting for the topological information of subpathways and its ability to provide an interactive view of the data in the KEGG pathways. Furthermore, TEAK’s GUI allows easy accessibility for a diverse set of users, and it implements an efficient algorithm to extract root-to-leaf linear subpathways where BFS and DFS algorithms may fail. Compared with previous approaches, TEAK also does not use differential gene expression analysis to determine modules of interest and is thus not sensitive to threshold values. Finally, by integrating the computational TEAK with experimental approaches, we have discovered and experimentally validated previously uncharacterized subpathways involved in the yeast stress response to nitrogen starvation.","PMC3561980"

"758","Primary data analysis was also performed at Hokkaido System Science. After adaptor trimming with the cutadapt program (http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/) and discarding reads containing N bases, filter-passed sequence reads from the founder RRLs were divided into 3 groups by their 5′-terminal sequences (both-end HaeIII, both-end MboI, and others). Sequence reads within a group were clustered by the clustering program “SEED” (http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/seed), and consensus sequences of 300 bp (read-pair) were generated. These consisted of forward and reverse 101-bp reads with internal 98 bases of N. Parameters in the program “SEED” were as follows: --shift was 0 and other parameters were defaults. Consensus sequences with depth ≥10 were used as reference sequences for mapping of read pairs from each founder. Consensus sequences used for mapping were deposited in the DDBJ sequence read archive under accession number DRZ002863. Mapping was performed by the short read aligner program “bowtie” (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml). Parameters in the program “bowtie” were as follows: -I was 300, -X was 300, -v was 3, and -- best option was specified.","PMC3749161"

"949","On this basis we have developed an open-source DAQ system, which is easy to extend and use. MANTA is written in MATLAB and makes use of a range of efficient coding strategies to allow fast plotting for 100's of channels. It supports natural visualization of arbitrary 1D, 2D and 3D electrode array geometries, integrates filtering, spike-sorting and denoising for online display, synchronization and communication with a control unit, and can acquire data from both analog and digital headstages. It is built using a modular design to facilitate and encourage the addition of new hardware and analysis tools. Being based on MATLAB, debugging and improving MANTA is a rapid process aided by an integrated simulation mode, and is thus easily accessible to the plethora of neuroscientists versed in MATLAB. MANTA is licensed under the GPL and can be freely used and improved (see code.google.com/p/manta-system).","PMC3644699"

"1494","Web sites associated with the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center (EuPathDB.org) have recently introduced a graphical user interface, the Strategies WDK, intended to make advanced searching and set and interval operations easy and accessible to all users. With a design guided by usability studies, the system helps motivate researchers to perform dynamic computational experiments and explore relationships across data sets. For example, PlasmoDB users seeking novel therapeutic targets may wish to locate putative enzymes that distinguish pathogens from their hosts, and that are expressed during appropriate developmental stages. When a researcher runs one of the approximately 100 searches available on the site, the search is presented as a first step in a strategy. The strategy is extended by running additional searches, which are combined with set operators (union, intersect or minus), or genomic interval operators (overlap, contains). A graphical display uses Venn diagrams to make the strategy’s flow obvious. The interface facilitates interactive adjustment of the component searches with changes propagating forward through the strategy. Users may save their strategies, creating protocols that can be shared with colleagues. The strategy system has now been deployed on all EuPathDB databases, and successfully deployed by other projects. The Strategies WDK uses a configurable MVC architecture that is compatible with most genomics and biological warehouse databases, and is available for download at code.google.com/p/strategies-wdk.","PMC3122067"

"1958","Alpha helices (AH) are peptide fragments characterized by regular patterns of hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen and amino nitrogen of residues regularly spaced in sequence, resulting in spiral conformations. Their preponderance in protein structures underlines their importance. Interestingly, AHs are present in most anti-microbial peptides, although they might remain in random-coil conformations depending on the solvent dielectric. For example, the cecropin component of the chimeric anti-microbial protein designed previously by our group comprises of two AHs linked by a short stretch of random coil. These anti-microbial peptides are often amphipathic (quantified by a hydrophobic moment), aligning hydrophobic residues on one surface and charged residues on the others. In the current work, we reproduce previously described computational methods to compute the hydrophobic moment of AHs - and provide open access to the source code (PAGAL). We simultaneously generated input files for TikZ (a package for creating high resolution graphics programmatically) to obtain the Edmundson wheel and showing the direction and magnitude of the hydrophobic moment, and Pymol scripts to generate color coded protein surfaces. Additionally, we have observed an empirical structural property of AHs: the distance between the Cα atoms of the ith and (i+4)th residue is equal to the distance between the carbonyl oxygens of the ith and (i+4)th residue. We validated this using 100 non-homologous high resolution structures from the PISCES database. The source code and manual is available at http://github.com/sanchak/pagal and on http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11136.","PMC4207245"

"2016","We present shinyMethyl, a Bioconductor package for interactive quality control of DNA methylation data from Illumina 450k arrays. The package summarizes 450k experiments into small exportable R objects from which an interactive interface is launched. Reactive plots allow fast and intuitive quality control assessment of the samples. In addition, exploration of the phenotypic associations is possible through coloring and principal component analysis. Altogether, the package makes it easy to perform quality assessment of large-scale methylation datasets, such as epigenome-wide association studies or the datasets available through The Cancer Genome Atlas portal. The shinyMethyl package is implemented in R and available via Bioconductor. Its development repository is at https://github.com/jfortin1/shinyMethyl.","PMC4176427"

"2238","The demand for accurate and reproducible phenotyping of a disease trait increases with the rising number of biobanks and genome wide association studies. Detailed analysis of histology is a powerful way of phenotyping human tissues. Nonetheless, purely visual assessment of histological slides is time-consuming and liable to sampling variation and optical illusions and thereby observer variation, and external validation may be cumbersome. Therefore, within our own biobank, computerized quantification of digitized histological slides is often preferred as a more precise and reproducible, and sometimes more sensitive approach. Relatively few free toolkits are, however, available for fully digitized microscopic slides, usually known as whole slides images. In order to comply with this need, we developed the slideToolkit as a fast method to handle large quantities of low contrast whole slides images using advanced cell detecting algorithms. The slideToolkit has been developed for modern personal computers and high-performance clusters (HPCs) and is available as an open-source project on github.com. We here illustrate the power of slideToolkit by a repeated measurement of 303 digital slides containing CD3 stained (DAB) abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue from a tissue biobank. Our workflow consists of four consecutive steps. In the first step (acquisition), whole slide images are collected and converted to TIFF files. In the second step (preparation), files are organized. The third step (tiles), creates multiple manageable tiles to count. In the fourth step (analysis), tissue is analyzed and results are stored in a data set. Using this method, two consecutive measurements of 303 slides showed an intraclass correlation of 0.99. In conclusion, slideToolkit provides a free, powerful and versatile collection of tools for automated feature analysis of whole slide images to create reproducible and meaningful phenotypic data sets.","PMC4220929"

"2269","In brief, reads for each sample were aligned to a portion the HXB2 reference genome (K03455.1) from position 3596 to 3996 using Mosaik (version 1.0.1388, github.com/wanpinglee/MOSAIK). Alignments outside the amplified region were ignored. Reads were cleaned of carry-forward and incomplete extension (CAFIE) and homopolymer/frameshift errors using RC454 [16]. After cleaning, reads were realigned with Mosaik. The alignments were passed to V-Phaser[15] for variant calling. Briefly, V-Phaser uses an autocalibration model to recalibrate quality scores for individual bases. After recalibration it then uses a combined pileup and two-site phasing model to identify positions or pairwise combinations of positions that have more minor alleles than would be expected at random accounting for the error probabilities predicted by the recalibrated base quality. Variant frequencies were then estimated based on the proportional observations of all valid alleles at each position, ignoring any reads that presented an allele at a given position that was not listed as a valid allele in the initial V-Phaser call set. 454 data is available at: http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=ERP004411.","PMC3946168"

"2294","GRAB is designed for analysis of WGS data and achieves prediction accuracy that is similar to current approaches. GRAB can directly read whole-genome variant information from standard formats without requiring additional file conversion utilities or user-guided selection of appropriate markers. The algorithm has been trained specifically for WGS data and evaluates all variants in the genome, taking advantage of information from both rare and common variants. Although GRAB is optimized for WGS, it is also applicable to high-density genotyping arrays. GRAB can be integrated into workflows such as Genome Management System (github.com/systemsbiology/GMS), which is capable of parsing pedigree file and comparing reported relationship with GRAB's prediction. As GRAB does not need phased data or population background statistics, it can be used for sparsely studied populations. Computation time is moderate, mostly spent reading data and computing IBS fractions. There are multiple ways to improve relationship estimation algorithms including phasing genotypes and using more realistic models of IBS distribution, but these may come with increased computation or a loss of specificity. We recommend GRAB for detecting 1st to 5th-degree relationships. For estimation of the degree of distant relationships, when phasing data is not available, block detection with ISCA and interpretation by ERSA works well [15]. If a representative population is available, population-based phasing with GERMLINE [14] and interpretation by ERSA works well. If computation time becomes limiting during analysis of a very large cohort, as may be the case in association studies requiring sequestration of closely related individuals, KING efficiently detects closer-than-3rd-degree relationships.","PMC3938395"

"2308","Case data, including cumulative incidence, and cumulative deaths, by date of report, for Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria were obtained from a public data repository maintained by Caitlin Rivers of Virginia Polytechnic Institute (https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola). These data are derived from official case counts from the World Health Organization, but have been aggregated and organized, making them an efficient resource for model fitting. Total case counts from this source do not distinguish between suspect, probable and confirmed case counts, and consequently cumulative incidence may decrease between measurements reflecting suspect cases who have been excluded through testing or other means. As only a fraction of cases are subject to virological confirmation, we also obtained virologically-confirmed case counts, by date, from the Virology Down Under blog, maintained by Dr. Ian Mackay (http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/). These estimates are, again, derived from World Health Organization reports. Dr. Mackay's graphs are created in the Tableau application, and numerical data can be obtained using Tableau (http://www.tableausoftware.com).","PMC4169344"

"2445","While initial phylogenetic analyses concluded to Guinea 2014 EBOV falling outside the Zaïre lineage (ZEBOV), a recent re-analysis of the same dataset by Dudas and Rambaut (2014) suggested that Guinea 2014 EBOV actually is ZEBOV. Under the same hypothesis as used by these authors (the molecular clock hypothesis), we reinforce their conclusion by providing a statistical assessment of the location of the root of the Zaïre lineage. Our analysis unambiguously supports Guinea 2014 EBOV as a member of the Zaïre lineage. In addition, we also show that some uncertainty exists so as to the location of the root of the genus Ebolavirus. We release the software we used for these re-analyses. RootAnnotator allows for the easy determination of branch root posterior probability from any posterior sample of clocked trees and is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rootannotator/.","PMC4073806"

"3725","Gene trees record the combination of gene-level events, such as duplication, transfer and loss (DTL), and species-level events, such as speciation and extinction. Gene tree–species tree reconciliation methods model these processes by drawing gene trees into the species tree using a series of gene and species-level events. The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always involves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable relationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species tree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees, the space of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of sequence evolution and gene tree–species tree reconciliation. Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic approach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of gene trees. We implement the ALE approach in the context of a reconciliation model (Szöllősi et al. 2013), which allows for the DTL of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate the sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled gene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood among all such trees. We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the joint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using sequence alone. Using realistic gene tree topologies, branch lengths, and alignment sizes, we demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of sequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families from 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference results in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with respectively. 24%, 59%, and 46% reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers, and losses per gene family. The open source implementation of ALE is available from https://github.com/ssolo/ALE.git.

"3817","Illumina TruSeq adapters were trimmed from the 3’ end of reads using the scythe software package (available from Buffalo, V. at https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics/scythe), and low-quality bases were trimmed using the sickle software package (available from Joshi, N. at https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics/sickle). Reads were aligned to the transcriptome using the bowtie read alignment software for single-end reads, with the maximum mismatches per read set at 2 and a seed length of 28 [63]. Read count per gene was calculated using SAMtools idxstats software [64]. For each sample, gene expression was quantified using the reads per Kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (RPKM) metric [65]. Differential expression was calculated between ∆veA and wild type, between OEveA and wild type, and between the complementation and wild-type strains. Two cutoffs were used to determine differentially regulated genes [61,62]. The first cutoff compared the fold difference between genes by calculating the relative RPKM (rRPKM = RPKMsample1/RPKMsample2) for each gene. The second cutoff compared the proportion of reads mapping to a gene in different samples using Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons. A gene was considered differentially regulated if the log2 rRPKM value was equal to or greater than 2 and the Bonferroni-corrected Fisher’s exact p-value was less than 0.05.","PMC3792039"

"4258","Efficient and easy-to-use software plays a critical role in computational biology research. Contact network approaches in epidemiology provide sophisticated analytical and efficient computational methods, but these can be technically challenging and time consuming to implement. Currently no open-source toolkit is available for facilitating contact network epidemiology research. We present EpiFire, an applications programming and graphical interface, available for Windows, OS X, and Linux online at sourceforge.net/projects/epifire. As the field of contact network epidemiology matures, so should its mathematical and computational toolkit. Open-source code libraries like EpiFire help to avoid programming mistakes, increase the transparency of analyses, and reduce barriers between the conception and implementation of ideas.","PMC3496579"

"4843","Exon 9 of SH3BP2 was amplified from genomic DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primers designed with Primer 3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net). Amplifications with primers 5’-CTTGCCGTCCTCACACAGAG-3’ and 5’-TTAGGAACTGTGGAGTCCTG-3’ were performed in 20 µL reactions containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, 4 mL 5x PCR buffer, 0.4 mL 10 mM dNTPs, 1.6 mL 25 mM Mgcl2, 8 µmol of each primer, and 1U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Unincorporated primers and dNTPs were removed by treating the PCR product with Exosap-IT according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). PCR products were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3730 automated sequencer (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ) and resulting sequences were compared to Genebank reference sequence NM_001145856.1.","PMC4119308"

"4856","Exon sequencing of CFHR5 was performed in the index case (III-5). Amplicons that targeted the exons and at least 50 bp of contiguous intronic sequence were amplified by PCR using primers (available on request) designed using the Primer3 software (primer3.sourceforge.net). Sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Both PCR and sequencing reaction products were purified using Edge Biosystems Gel Filtration plates (Life Technologies). The sequence was run on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies) and analyzed using the Sequencer DNA sequencing analysis software. Genomic DNA was analyzed using the Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification P236-A1 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, www.mlpa.com). Assay readings were validated using samples from individuals with known copy-number variation across the CFH-CFHR locus. TaqMan probe HS03382618_cn at position chr1:196952738 (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, United Kingdom www.appliedbiosystems.com) was additionally used to validate copy-number variation across the CFHR5 gene. To detect the intronic breakpoint by PCR using genomic DNA, we used the following primers: 5′-TATTGGCTGTGGGTTTGTCA-3′, 5′-GAATTTTAGACCCATATCCCTGAT-3′, and 5′-TGACTGATCACTTATATCACAGTTGG-3′. The 5′-TATTGGCTGTGGGTTTGTCA-3′ and 5′-GAATTTTAGACCCATATCCCTGAT-3′ pair amplify the 337-bp wild-type amplicon, whereas 5′-TATTGGCTGTGGGTTTGTCA-3′ and 5′-TGACTGATCACTTATATCACAGTTGG-3′ pair amplify a 239-bp amplicon if the intronic breakpoint is present. PCR was performed using Qiagen HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) with 10 ng of genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both reactions were multiplexed in the same reaction.","PMC3789233"

"4965","One of the researchers arranged, rehearsed, and recorded each of the four excerpts, creating one high (E+) and one low (E-) expression version, yielding a total of eight different performances. For each pair (E+, E-), the conductor utilized a metronome and headset to ensure tempo consistency. During the recording process, performers were instructed to maximize or minimize variance of the target characteristic (articulations or dynamics) and perform all other variables as similarly as possible. In other words, excerpts focusing on articulation were performed at a consistent dynamic level and excerpts focusing on dynamics were performed with consistent articulation throughout. For the low-expression/neutral (E-) condition, we instructed the performers not to vary articulation values, dynamics, or any other expressive elements. Visual waveform analysis performed on each excerpt through the Audacity audio editor (sourceforge.net) showed distinct contrast between performance conditions along the target characteristics (Figure 1). Additionally, the researchers (all university music faculty members or graduate music instructors) reviewed the audio segments and agreed that there were clear contrasts between performance conditions and that tempo was consistent across each excerpt pair.","PMC4109431"

C-Sibelia takes as input two FASTA files and produces: (1) a VCF file containing all identified single nucleotide variations and indels; (2) an XMFA file containing alignment information. The software also produces Circos diagrams visualizing high level genomic architecture for rearrangement analyses. C-Sibelia is a part of the Sibelia comparative genomics suite, which is freely available under the GNU GPL v.2 license at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sibelia-bio.

"5400","In this paper, we presented a novel algorithm to identify SNP interactions associated with a quantitative outcome. There are two unique contributions from this paper: first of all, we offer a computationally efficient algorithm, QMDR, to identify epistatic models that are associated with a quantitative outcome. We have distributed free Java-based software for this QMDR on sourceforge.net. Secondly, we present a testing score that is “invariant” for all sample sizes, number of SNPs and interaction orders. Simulations and real data analyses both showed that the empirical p-value is very close to permutated p-value thereby permitting a significant reduction in computing time.","PMC3689797"

"5522","Low-cost DNA sequencing technologies have expanded the role for direct nucleic acid sequencing in the analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, and the metagenomes of whole ecosystems. Human and machine comprehension of such large datasets can be simplified via synthesis of sequence fragments into long, contiguous blocks of sequence (contigs), but most of the progress in the field of assembly has focused on genomes in isolation rather than metagenomes. Here, we present software for paired-read iterative contig extension (PRICE), a strategy for focused assembly of particular nucleic acid species using complex metagenomic data as input. We describe the assembly strategy implemented by PRICE and provide examples of its application to the sequence of particular genes, transcripts, and virus genomes from complex multicomponent datasets, including an assembly of the BCBL-1 strain of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. PRICE is open-source and available for free download (derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/price/ or sourceforge.net/projects/pricedenovo/).","PMC3656733"

"5525","HR and 95% CI were used as the effective value to measure the impact of ALDH expression on survival of ovarian cancer patients in this meta-analysis. In the individual study, some of them provided HR and 95% CI directly. For some other studies not given these data clearly, we calculated from available data or Kaplan-Meier survive cure by using Engauge Digitizer version 4.1 (free software down-loaded from http://sourceforge.net). If a study provided both the results of multivariate analysis and univariate analysis, we chose the former. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Chi-squared test. The I2 value was used to evaluate the heterogeneity (I2 = 0-50%, no or moderate heterogeneity; I2 > 50%, significant heterogeneity) [27]. Begg's test and Egger's test were performed to identify the possibility of publication bias [28,29]. Fixed-effect model was used if there was no significant heterogeneity. Otherwise, the random-effect model was used. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the stability of the pooled results. By convention, an observed HR > 1 implied a poor survival for the group with increased ALDH expression. The impact of increased ALDH expression on survival was considered statistically significant if the 95% CI did not overlap with 1. All the p-values were two sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted with STATA 12.0.","PMC3839885"

"5756","For each of the positional candidates, sequence-specific oligonucleotide markers covering individual exons and splice sites sequences were designed (primer3.sourceforge.net). Sequences were amplified by conventional PCR with tail DNA from A and B6 inbred mice, and the sequence of the PCR products was determined by automated DNA sequencing (McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, QC).","PMC3597735"
"5757","Over 87 000 reads with an average of 368 bases (32.2 Mb total) were obtained on 1/8 region of a plate. Basic quality control analysis was performed using in-house tools. Reads were mapped to the reference genome mm37.59 (from ENSEMBL). A total of 73 016 reads where mapped to the reference sequence (83:4% of the original reads). Using these mapped reads, we created a list of putative SNPs (a.k.a. pileup). SNPs with quality lower than 200 were filtered out (arbitrary threshold). After filtering out low quality predictions, the effect of the remaining 236 SNPs was predicted using SnpE (snpeff.sourceforge.net). Coverage variations analysis was performed in order to find long deletions (over 10 bases). We used a sliding window average to enumerate regions with coverage lower than a threshold, which allow us to detect the presence of a single indel, a 54 bp-deletion downstream of exon 15 of Nfκb1. Any sequence displaying lower density coverage were repeated with amplification by standard PCR (Primers listed in Table S2) followed by Sanger sequencing.","PMC3597735"

"6086","To identify potential novel miRNAs, the software Mireap (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mireap) was used to explore the secondary structure, the Dicer cleavage site, and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small RNA tags which could be mapped to genome. In brief, the sequence length should be between 18–26 nt, maximal free energy allowed for a miRNA precursor was ~18 kcal/mol, maximal space between miRNA and miRNA* was 35 nt, and flanking sequence length of miRNA precursor should be 10 nt. After filtering in above analysis pipeline, unannotated small RNA tags were aligned with mature miRNAs from miRBase18.0 to detect miRNA editing allowing one mismatch on certain position of miRNAs. To eliminate sequence changes generated by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the genomic DNA, the results were filtered with SNP database (Build 130) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/index.html). IsomiR analysis was conducted by aligning the reads to precursor sequence and mature sequence of miRNAs. IsomiRs were divided into 8 groups as follows: 1, Addition of nucleotides at both 3’ and 5’ ends; 2, Addition of nucleotides at 5’ end; 3, Addition of nucleotides at 3’ end; 4, Addition at 5’ end and trimming of nucleotides at 3’ end; 5, Trimming at 5’ end; 6, Trimming at both 3’ and 5’ ends; 7, Trimming at 3’ end; 8, Trimming at 5’ end and addition at 3’ end. Pearson’s correlation algorithms were used to assess the correlation between read counts per miRNA of the two P0 samples.","PMC3441217"

"6244","Local network alignment is an important component of the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks that may lead to the identification of evolutionary related complexes. We present AlignNemo, a new algorithm that, given the networks of two organisms, uncovers subnetworks of proteins that relate in biological function and topology of interactions. The discovered conserved subnetworks have a general topology and need not to correspond to specific interaction patterns, so that they more closely fit the models of functional complexes proposed in the literature. The algorithm is able to handle sparse interaction data with an expansion process that at each step explores the local topology of the networks beyond the proteins directly interacting with the current solution. To assess the performance of AlignNemo, we ran a series of benchmarks using statistical measures as well as biological knowledge. Based on reference datasets of protein complexes, AlignNemo shows better performance than other methods in terms of both precision and recall. We show our solutions to be biologically sound using the concept of semantic similarity applied to Gene Ontology vocabularies. The binaries of AlignNemo and supplementary details about the algorithms and the experiments are available at: sourceforge.net/p/alignnemo.","PMC3373574"

"6349","The rapid increase in genomic and genome-scale data is resulting in unprecedented levels of discrete sequence data available for phylogenetic analyses.  Major analytical impasses exist, however, prior to analyzing these data with existing phylogenetic software.  Obstacles include the management of large data sets without standardized naming conventions, identification and filtering of orthologous clusters of proteins or genes, and the assembly of alignments of orthologous sequence data into individual and concatenated super alignments.  Here we report the production of an automated pipeline, Hal that produces multiple alignments and trees from genomic data.  These alignments can be produced by a choice of four alignment programs and analyzed by a variety of phylogenetic programs.  In short, the Hal pipeline connects the programs BLASTP, MCL, user specified alignment programs, GBlocks, ProtTest and user specified phylogenetic programs to produce species trees.  The script is available at sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-hal/).  The results from an example analysis of Kingdom Fungi are briefly discussed.","PMC3038436"

Primers were designed with Primer3 software (http://primer3.sourceforge.net), and the size of PCR products was confirmed by the pattern of restriction enzyme digested fragments using the LabChip DNA 500 Kit on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Two, 0.5, and 0.125 ng of genome DNA from an individual with CNV were used and the quantification of each amplicon was carried out at 45 cycles of PCR. The results were analyzed with Light Cycler Data Analysis software using a second derivative maximum model. Relative DNA content of variants for every amplimer was calculated using “normals” (individuals who did not have CNVs) as a control.","PMC3010704"

"6604","Certainly other sources of bias and error exist in the present study, but the intention here is to help determine to what degree the choice of machine learning technique and feature mapping method might produce different results in modeling siRNA effectiveness, possibly accounting for some of the heterogeneity seen in previously published studies modeling siRNA activity and what features produce maximally predictive models. These features have then been interpreted as the most relevant, but this interpretation needs to be placed clearly in the light of their relevance to a model's predictability and not necessarily of their biological relevance. The methods and techniques presented here are all available for download from sourceforge.net (http://sourceforge.net/projects/seq2svm/) as a group of C++ classes and interfaces for their execution. Finally, to provide access to additional data mining and learning techniques in a graphical interface, there is also an executable that transforms a siRNA dataset, by various methods, into an attribute-relation file format (ARFF), appropriate for use in the Waikato environment for knowledge analysis (WEKA).","PMC2760777"

"6746","The Instrumental and Industrial Digital Camera (IIDC) standard compliant camera we use has two major advantages: flexibility and control. Various software and software libraries are available to record from IIDC cameras, including open source solutions such as Coriander (damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/coriander/) and the 1394-based DC Control library (sourceforge.net/projects/libdc1394). This flexibility means that the hardware is not locked to any single proprietary software solution. IIDC standard compliance also gives one the flexibility to upgrade the hardware and/or software easily without changing any other component. Finally, IIDC standard gave us complete software control over the exposure time and other parameters of the camera. It also allows one to record uncompressed movies, which simplifies image analysis. Camera systems such as digital video (DV) system, which is commonly used in handheld movie cameras, can only send compressed output to the computer. This results in degraded image quality.","PMC3012681"

"6764","The third problem concerns the choice of an appropriate supervised learning or classification algorithm. Here, we use a decision tree approach, where the leaves of the tree represent the output classifications, each node corresponds to a specific attribute and the branches correspond to a range of attribute values. We tested three widely used decision tree algorithms implemented in the Weka software (sourceforge.net/projects/weka/):
The C4.5 (43) (known in Weka as J48) algorithm generates a classification or decision tree by recursive partitioning of the dataset. At each node of the tree, C4.5 chooses one attribute of the data that most effectively splits the samples into subsets enriched in one class or the other, based on a normalized information gain score.The Random Tree algorithm (44) is a fast decision tree learner that constructs a tree from random permutations. With k random features at each node, a tree is drawn at random from a set of possible trees and again, information gain is used as a selection criterion.The Random Forest algorithm (45) combines an ensemble classifier and the random selection of features, in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variation. Each tree defines a classification, and is said to ‘vote’ for that classification. The forest algorithm then chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).

"6913","DCM4CHEE is easily set up and includes comprehensive logging of DICOM transactions. The archive comes in a precompiled (binary) version designed for two open-source and readily available databases, MySQL and POSTGRES. The package available on sourceforge.net4 comes with directions for setting up the archive on multiple operating systems.5 The depth of the installation documentation provides one example of the maturity of DCM4CHEE. Its web-based graphical user interface (GUI) provides the ability to search the archive and offers a number of other operations that can be performed without the need of in-depth DICOM knowledge. The log files allow the user to view the DICOM transactions produced by the GUI. By viewing the log of the GUI transactions, even a novice can glean the required information for DICOM transactions and, in the process, gain insight into how the standard works. Setting up and using the archive and experimenting with the toolkit is a productive way to gain experience with the DICOM standard.","PMC2039778"
